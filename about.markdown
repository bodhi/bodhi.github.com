title: About Techscursion
---

Techscursion is an [archive](/archive) of articles and links on
programming. It's also a manufactured excuse to attempt go
ultra-minimal on style. It's also a place where I plan to push myself
to <del>vote</del> launch early, launch often, go all
[MVP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) and
actually just write shit.

<aside>Hah, the irony. After writing the preceeding I spent an hour
dicking around with the site's CSS.</aside>

After failing several times, I've also decided to link to other
interesting programming-related stuff around the internet, hopefully
that will make me a bit more active, and trick me into actually
writing stuff too.

Techscursion is written by me, Bodhi. I'm a software developer
working mostly in the echo-chamber of web application development. I
work for [The Plant](http://theplant.jp), have a neglected… er…
creative outlet over at [Keshiki](http://keshiki.net) - which has been
offline since the [TextDrive/Joyent PR
disaster](http://gigaom.com/2012/08/30/a-user-revolt-and-the-second-coming-of-textdrive/)
– and I tweet ([@bodhi](http://twitter.com/bodhi)) but not very often.

Techscursion is, obviously, a *portmanteau*, obviously, of
*technology* and *excursion*. Imagine me here imitating the [Martians
on Sesame Street](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTc3PsW5ghQ).
